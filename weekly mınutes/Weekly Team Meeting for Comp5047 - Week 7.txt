3.	Think about how the Subsystems come together. Attempt to design the architectural design of the whole system once we have our microservice diagrams completed

 
Next Meeting:
1.	Review architectural diagrams created individually.
2.	Look to define the architectural design of the whole system.
3.	GitHub Tidy-up
 
Notes/Comments:
1. Attempted to contact p4, no response

"a.	You should specify the architectural designs in the UML component diagrams with a set of component nodes that represent microservices and a set of interfaces to represent the APIs that are the connectors between them. 
b.	The components and connectors in architectural designs, including their methods and parameters, should be specified in a textual documentation to define their functionalities and meanings. 
c.	In this part of the design, you are not required to give the internal structure of the components, which will be the work of the task on detailed design."
